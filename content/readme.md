Thanks for dropping in. My name's Oliver. I enjoy software development, music, photography, electronics and writing. I've started this blog as a means to document and share the things that I do.

I'm focusing most of my time at the moment to my music player: Portajel, maintaining this website, as well as the music I'm recording with my band.

Professionally, I'm experienced in information technology and software development. I got started in 2021 working part-time IT help desk with Monadelphous whilst I completed a diploma in Software Development, after which I went onto full time work. I moved in October 2024 to Dapth, predominantly working as a SharePoint consultant for anyone who needed their information organised. In June of 2025, I left Dapth to pursue more meaningful projects, and have been freelancing since.

If you're interested in contacting me, I can be reached at mail@oli.fm

Thank you for visiting, and have a nice day.
