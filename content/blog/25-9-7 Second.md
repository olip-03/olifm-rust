Welcome to my new blogging site. I've built this with .Net Blazor WebAssembly, and I'm hosting it through Github Pages completely for free! The static content .Net WebAssembly sends through the line is already really fat and heavy, so I was reluctant to include content (as in pages and images) with the build. Instead, the app makes a bunch of API calls to another [repository](https://github.com/olip-03/oli-fm-content) and gets page contents from there. It does means that the content takes a sec to load in, but hey, I'm not paying for it.   

 it has it's ups and downs, but the end result is pretty good. All that's left now is to get the pages looking a little nicer :)
