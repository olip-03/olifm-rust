I'm often working on cool projects that I want to share with my friends. Writing out the same article seven different times gets quite cumbersome, so go figure, I'll put them all on a website. 

Welcome to my new blog. I've written this website using Rust compiled to WebAssembly, on-top of Github Pages for static content hosting. If you don't know what any of that mean, don't worry! It doesn't really matter. The end result is a neat little high-performance website perfect for sharing more of the work that I do. And the best part is it's totally free. 

WebAssembly means I can get away with a lot more than I would with a static site. The filtering options I've added wouldn't be possible without them. The fancy placeholder backgrounds for all the images wouldn't be here either without it.

I've got a lot of old projects I still need to write-up that I'd like to have shared here, so keep around if you'd like to see more. 

Stay tuned!
